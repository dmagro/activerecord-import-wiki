The below benchmarks were done with MySQL 5.4.12 on Mac OSX 10.5.8, testing against the database engine types for InnoDb and MyISAM. The ActiveRecord model names used were TestInnoDb and TestMyISAM. All times are displayed in seconds.

*create* in the below benchmarks refers to using ActiveRecord's standard create method. *import* refers to using the import method added by activerecord-import.
