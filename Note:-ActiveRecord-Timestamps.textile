h2. Timestamps

If you're familiar with ActiveRecord you're probably familiar with its timestamp columns: created_at, created_on, updated_at, updated_on, etc. When importing data the timestamp fields will continue to work as expected and each timestamp column will be set.

h2. Timezones

If you are using custom time zones, these will be respected when performing imports as well as long as @ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone@ is set, which for practically all Rails apps it is.
