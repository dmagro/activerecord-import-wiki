There are essentially two ways to require activerecord-import:

* Using Bundler (default Rails 3 app uses this)
* Not using Bundler

_These instructions only work for activerecord-import 0.2.0 or higher. If you have a version before 0.2.0 then upgrade._

h2. Using Bundler

There are two ways you can use Bundler. First, the Rails 3 way.

h3. The Rails 3 Way - autoloading gem dependencies

Rails 3 by default autoloads your gem dependencies (thanks to config/application.rb). When this happens you only need to make sure activerecord-import is specified as a gem dependency in your Gemfile. 

<pre>
  gem "activerecord-import", ">= 0.2.0"
</pre>

h3. Not autoloading

If your gem dependencies aren't autoloaded then simply require activerecord-import after activerecord has been loaded, ie:

<pre>
require 'active_record'
require 'activerecord-import'
</pre>

That's it.
