h1. Autorequiring

As of activerecord-import 0.2.0 you no longer need to supply the adapter name when requiring the library. Before 0.2.0 you had to specify the adapter name in the require:

<pre>
require 'activerecord-import/mysql'
</pre>

Now you don't have to so you should update your code to load activerecord-import this way instead:

<pre>
require 'activerecord-import'
</pre>

This allows activerecord-import to see what adapter you are using and to automatically load the necessary support for that particular adapter.

h1. Loading specific adapters

If you cannot use the autorequire (perhaps you are connecting to multiple databases with different database adapters) you can force activerecord-import to load support for one or more adapters using the following mechanism:

<pre>
require 'activerecord-import' # this will autorequire support for the current ActiveRecord::Base.connection's adapter

# the next two lines will specifically load support for mysql and sqlite3
ActiveRecord::Import.require_adapter 'mysql'
ActiveRecord::Import.require_adapter 'sqlite3'
</pre>
